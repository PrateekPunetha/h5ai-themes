These icon themes were previously shipped with [h5ai][h5ai]. Put these theme
folders into folder `_h5ai/public/images/themes/` of your h5ai installation, so that
the file structure will be `_h5ai/public/images/themes/<theme-name>/<type>.<ext>`.

To select a theme use the option `view > theme` in file `_h5ai/conf/options.json`.
